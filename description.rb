<div><p>In this challenge, we will be writing methods and appropriate regular expressions to find, hide and format social security numbers. </p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Use the driver code in the gist to guide you to a working solution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add additional driver code where you want to feel more comfortable with your implementation. For instance, what happens when you pass a string with only a single SSN into the <code class="inline">hide_all_ssns</code> or <code class="inline">get_all_ssns</code> methods?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Did adding driver code help you solve the challenge more effectively? How? (Answer in the gist as a comment)</p>
</li>
</ol>
